This is DO+ (doplus), the high-level, extensible iteration construct for Common Lisp.

By design, doplus has a reasonably simple implementation, that in particular doesn't
make use of a code walker, allowing users to freely mix doplus loops with macrolets
and every other kind of advanced Lisp construct.

--- Installation ---

You can load doplus with ASDF. The system name is :doplus and the .asd file resides
in the same directory as this README file.

--- Dependencies ---

doplus depends only on parse-declarations and Eos (the latter only if you want
to run the test suite).

--- Tests ---

To run the test suite, load the system :doplus-tests after loading :doplus itself.
To rerun the test suite after :doplus-tests has been loaded, evaluate the form
(doplus-tests:run-all-tests).

--- License ---

doplus is distributed under the GPLv3. See the file COPYING for details.
Please contact the author if you have questions about licensing or if you want to use doplus
under a different license.
